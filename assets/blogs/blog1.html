        <div class="blog-content">
        <p>In recent years, digital marketing has exploded onto the marketing scene, and its effects have been anything but 
          small. Traditional marketers and old-school companies have struggled to keep up with the ever-changing world of 
          internet marketing while customers, leads, and clients have become more adept in this new landscape. But companies
          can’t afford to ignore changes in the way people look to buy, and that is why they have stepped into the modern
          way of marketing. </p><br>

        <h2 class="blog-subheading" id="whatisdm">What is Digital Marketing?</h2><br>

        <p>Digital marketing is the practice of promoting products or services with the help of digital devices and technology.<br><br>

          In simple words, digital marketing is any form of marketing that occurs online with the help of mobile, laptop, internet,
          etc. In addition to digital signage and technology that may not be connected to the internet. It can range from anything
          as complex as automated email marketing initiatives all the way down to the content choices on your website’s blog.<br><br>
          
          Now, you know what is digital marketing, so let's proceed and know the types of digital marketing. </p><br>

          <h2 class="blog-subheading" id="tdm">Types of Digital Marketing</h2><br>
          

          <p>
            If you have a computer or a smartphone, as many of us do, you’ve experienced digital marketing. It could be an email
            in your inbox, a search result when using Google, an ad on Facebook, a text message sent to your phone, or a post by
            an influencer on Instagram. As you can see, internet marketing is an expansive field with many areas of specialization. 
            The core forms of digital marketing, however, are:<br><br>

              <b>1. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</b><br><br>
              Put, SEO consists of carefully structuring and optimizing your website’s pages to achieve the best position possible 
              on search engine result pages (SERPs) when internet users perform a search on an engine like Google that’s related to 
              your business.<br><br>

              <b>2. Paid Social and Paid Search Advertising</b><br><br>
              Ads that appear on social media are paid social ads, and all that seems on SERPs when you enter a query are paid search
              ads. Advertisers create these paid ads and compete with others for positions on their chosen social platform or the SERP
              for their selected search engine.<br><br>

              <b>3. Email Marketing</b><br><br>
              Any marketing that occurs through email is known as email marketing, and it’s not just for newsletters and coupons.
              All marketing-related interaction over email fits into this category.<br><br>

              <img class="blog-images" src="https://www.hillarysmarkets.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/blog3.jpg"   alt="Types of Digital Marketing"> <br>

              <b>4. Content Marketing</b><br><br>
              Every effort to market through online content is considered content marketing (and often employs SEO, paid search, and
              paid social advertising). For example, all these content types (and more) are grouped under the content marketing category:<br><br>

              <ol>
                <li>a.Blog posts</li><br>
                <li>b.Infographics</li><br>
                <li>c.Videos</li><br>
                <li>d.eBooks</li><br>
                <li>e.White papers </li>
              </ol><br>
            
        
              <b>5. Affiliate Marketing</b><br><br>
              Affiliate marketing is a type of digital marketing in which companies reach out to third party websites to advertise their products
              and services. These are also known as referrals. The target audience of the affiliate website becomes important in this aspect of
              digital marketing. Some of the ways that affiliates are incentivized are based on:<br><br>
              
              <ol>
                <li>a.Registrations</li><br>
                <li>b.Email sign-ups</li><br>
                <li>c.Sales and</li><br>
                <li>d.Subscriptions</li>
              </ol><br>

              <b>6. Mobile Marketing</b><br><br>
              Mobile Marketing is a type of digital marketing focused on reaching the target audience via mobile devices. We all are excessive users
              of mobile devices and there is a good chance of tapping on to their attention by following simple marketing strategies.
              Push notifications, emailers, social media posts, MMS, SMS, newsletters are a part of Mobile Marketing. <br><br>


              <b>7. Social Media Marketing</b><br><br>
              Social Media Marketing is a practice that increases brand awareness, and helps brands achieve their marketing objectives. 
              A wide range of content buckets are available for social media marketing like videos, memes, static posts, trending posts, 
              testimonials, stories, reels, etc.. If you perform SMM properly, there is a high chance that your conversion rates will
              increase, you will be able to build a good top-funnel traffic, and your paid marketing cost will go down. <br><br>

              Other types of digital marketing include marketing automation, design, apps, and SMS, web analytics, and growth hacking.<br><br>
          </p>
          <h2 class="blog-subheading" id="whyisdmimp">Why is Digital Marketing Important?</h2><br>

          <p><ol>

            <li>h.It allows businesses to market to people by various means that show individual respect. </li><br>
          </ol><br> </p>

          <h2 class="blog-subheading" id="ddmwfab">Does Digital Marketing Work For All Businesses?</h2><br>
          <p>Absolutely! It can work for any business and is not constrained to the niche or size. The prime motto 
            of digital marketing is to understand the necessities and requirements of consumers and provide high-quality, 
            relevant content for them. The following discusses how digital marketing works for two primary business branches.</p><br>

            <h3>B2B Digital Marketing</h3><br>

            <p>The marketing agenda followed by most B2B businesses focuses on the logic and features of the product.
               There is little to no emotion involved in influencing the purchase decisions of these businesses. 
               In simple terms, B2B Digital marketing doesn't rely on product promotion and focuses on how a business uses it. </p><br>

            <h3>B2C Digital Marketing</h3><br>

            <p>This is the profitable stream to venture into digital marketing as it focuses more on product benefits. 
              Since purchase decisions are influenced by emotions rather than just buying the product, B2C businesses
              use a variety of forums to generate brand awareness and promote business to grow sales. This is because
              consumers no longer just want to know the brand's benefits. Instead, they want the brand to describe how
              the product will benefit them.</p><br>

          <h2 class="blog-subheading" id="benefitsofdm">Benefits of Digital Marketing</h2><br>
          <p>Digital marketing has become hugely popular in such a short period, and for a good reason. Today’s customers
            and clients spend an increasing amount of time online, and they expect their favorite companies to be online, too.<br><br>

            The internet landscape might seem intimidating, but effective digital marketing can be an enormous boon for business.
            With careful strategy and implementation, the benefits of digital marketing on business include the expansion of the 
            audience, meeting target customers where they’re spending their time, and achieving this for a far more affordable 
            price than traditional marketing methods allow.<br><br>
            
            For these reasons and more, more than 60 percent of marketers have moved their focus from traditional to digital marketing.</p><br>
          
          <h2 class="blog-subheading" id="howdmworks">How Digital Marketing Works?</h2><br> 
          <p>While the benefits of digital marketing are plentiful, understand that each form of internet marketing functions
             in its way. Companies would be wise to assess the bigger picture before determining which forms of digital 
             marketing in which to invest and which platforms to use. It’s generally recommended to crawl before you
             walk–start small with your online marketing strategy and grow as the company becomes accustomed to different areas.<br><br>

            Digital marketing is hugely helpful to firms in that it allows them to grow their audience as far as their budget allows.
            On the other side of the coin, internet marketing offers companies the chance to focus clearly on marketing to the right audience.
             In other words, a firm may reach the perfect target clientele on a local, national, or international stage, all while staying 
             on budget. </p> <br><br>

          <h2 class="blog-subheading" id="whatdoesdmdo">What Does A Digital Marketer Do?</h2><br>
